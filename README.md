# Artificial Intelligence project - Multi robot path planning problem

## Multi agent path finding problem using A* Heuristic

The multi-robot path planning problem is the problem of finding optimal (or close to optimal) paths for n robots simultaneously without collisions where each robot has a designated start and goal state. This problem can be solved in different ways, ranging from greedy search methods to heuristic algorithms.

The goal is to implement a program that creates a grid (environment in which the robots operate) and initial information which includes the number of robots (at least 3), their starting and goal positions on the grid, as well as the position of obstacles. The program should show how the robots traverse their paths to their goal states on the grid.

The program must be able to:

i) Read the input (number of robots, start & goal states, position of obstacles, etc.)

ii) Show the movement of the robots.

iii) Display the output.
